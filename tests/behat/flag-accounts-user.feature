Feature: SAML2 flagged accounts login
  In order to have correct Moodle access
  As a user
  I need to have my account checked for flags when logging in through SAML2 service provider

  Scenario: If my account is flagged and I log in via SAML2 I should not have Moodle access
    Given the authentication plugin saml2 is enabled                                     # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "Dual Login" is set to "passive"                               # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "Flagged response type" is set to "Display custom message"     # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "flagmessage" is set to "No access"                            # auth_saml2
    When I go to the login page                                                          # auth_saml2
    And I follow "Login via SAML2"
    Then I should see "A service has requested you to authenticate yourself"
    And I set the field "Username" to "studentflagged"
    And I set the field "Password" to "studentpass"
    And I press "Login"
    Then I should see "You are not logged in."

  Scenario: If my account is flagged and redirect page is set, on SAML2 login I should see the redirect page
    Given the authentication plugin saml2 is enabled                                     # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "Dual Login" is set to "passive"                               # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "Flagged response type" is set to "Redirect to external URL"   # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "flagredirecturl" is set to "https://en.wikipedia.org"         # auth_saml2
    When I go to the login page                                                          # auth_saml2
    And I follow "Login via SAML2"
    Then I should see "A service has requested you to authenticate yourself"
    And I set the field "Username" to "studentflagged"
    And I set the field "Password" to "studentpass"
    And I press "Login"
    Then I should see "Wikipedia"
    And I should not see "Moodle"

  Scenario: If my account is flagged and response message is set, on SAML2 login I should see the response message
    Given the authentication plugin saml2 is enabled                                     # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "Dual Login" is set to "no"                                    # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "Flagged response type" is set to "Display custom message"     # auth_saml2
    And the saml2 setting "flagmessage" is set to "No access"                            # auth_saml2
    When I go to the login page                                                          # auth_saml2

    And I set the field "Username" to "studentflagged"
    And I set the field "Password" to "studentpass"
